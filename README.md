# E-commerce Back End Starter Code

During this challenge I had the opportunity to learn a lot about ORM and how to connect different files/programs together. This is one of the toughest challenges we've had so far, but with the help of my tutor, professor, and TA's I was able to overcome certain obsticles that were holding me back from progressing. I had to make multiple files in order to accomplish what I wanted to and that was a challenging experience in itself. I was able to build an ORM based on the requirements that we're being asked of. I really enjoyed this weeks challenge because it feels like were getting more into more challenging programs while putting everything together a little more each week. Learning more in depth stuff is really progressing my knowledge and helping me understand things I wasn't understanding in previous weeks. I definitely struggled a lot with ORM and some of the other backend stuff we've been working on, but I can tell I'm understanding it much better than I was a few weeks ago.
